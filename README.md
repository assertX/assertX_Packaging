In this assignment, you have two kinds of boxes, small boxes (cube-shaped) and large boxes (cuboid-shaped).  Your task is to pack as many small boxes as possible inside a large box.  You are going to write a Java program that calculates the maximum number of small boxes that can be completely placed inside a large box.

The input file is a plain text file (filename: dimensions.txt).

•There are two rows of data stored in the input file.  The first row contains a single positive integer, which is the dimension of the small box.  Since a small box is cubic, so its length, width, and height are the same.  The second row contains exactly 3 positive integers (separated by whitespaces), which are the length, width, and height of the large boxes (in that order).

•There are no empty lines anywhere in the input file.

•You cannot assume (or guess) the range of the input values.  In other words, no matter how large (or how small) the boxes are, your program should correctly process them.

The result.txt file will be create by the program. This text file will contain the results.

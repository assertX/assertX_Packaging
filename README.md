In this assignment, you have two kinds of boxes, small boxes (cube-shaped) and large boxes (cuboid-shaped).  Your task is to pack as many small boxes as possible inside a large box.  You are going to write a Java program that calculates the maximum number of small boxes that can be completely placed inside a large box.

The dimensions will be read from a input text file. The program will create the result.txt and write those results to that file for you.
